Hi, My name is Yurii, and I’m currently a student at Code Fellows in Seattle. I’m studying JS right now, and planing to study Python in next couple of months. Let me tell you a little bit about myself: my greatest strength is perseverance, everything in my life, I achieved by working hard and smart, I’m always trying to find best solution. And if I’m failing, I like to take a step back to think around, and try again, until I succeed . I have consistently shown commitment and motivation in every company I worked. I meet set deadlines and objectives on time even if a have to work late. At the same time I don’t know when to stop, even tho I need a little break. Once I get to know people, I’m pretty good in teamwork, I believe that my skills and my ability to work in a team are valuable. In regards to the areas in which I could improve, I will be the first to admit that I struggled when interacting with people I don’t know well, I am still uncertain as to how to improve myself. But I think recognition of the problem is halfway to solve it.
